## Image Gallery
I’ve just completed my very first web page project: a Simple Image Gallery!

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been diving into HTML and CSS through some fantastic YouTube tutorials. This project has been an excellent way to put my new skills into practice and see them come to life. From crafting the layout to styling the images, it’s been a rewarding journey.

## Project Highlights:
- HTML Structure: Clean and semantic markup for an organized gallery.
- CSS Styling: Responsive design to ensure a great look on any device.
- User Experience: Intuitive navigation and elegant presentation.

I’m eager to keep learning and tackling new challenges in web development. A big thanks to all the amazing resources and the supportive community that’s been part of this journey!
